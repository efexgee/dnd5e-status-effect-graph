# dnd5e-status-effect-graph
##Attempt to render D&D 5e status effects as a graph.
There are many status effects in D&D 5th Edition and they are nested. For example, the rules for status effect C might read "C has all the effects of B and A, plus blah." Visually representing this nesting would make it much easier to remember the rules for different status effects.
